          If this applies, Your subscription begins as soon as your initial payment is processed. Your subscription will automatically renew annually without notice until you cancel. You authorize us to store your payment method(s) and to automatically charge your payment method(s) every year or month (depending on the payment agreement) until you cancel. We will automatically charge you the then-current rate for your plan, plus applicable taxes (such as VAT or GST if the rate does not include it), every year or month (depending on the payment agreement) of your contract length until you cancel. The length of our subscription package is 12months from the moment your initial payment is processed, and your term will keep on rolling thereafter until you decide to cancel.

        </p>
        <p class="bottom-margin _10-pixels">
          If your primary payment method fails, you authorize us to charge any other payment method in your account.

You can edit your payment information anytime on your PVROOF software.
        </p>
        <p class="bottom-margin _10-pixels">
          For European Economic Area customers, your bank may require you to authenticate your initial purchase using a password, a one-time code sent to your mobile number, or biometric recognition. When you authenticate, you also authorize us to charge your payment method for your additional purchases without providing us further payment information or other instructions (i.e., we will initiate future payments independently). Such additional purchases may occur when we automatically charge your payment method in connection with a recurring subscription or when you add or change licenses or products.          
        </p>

        <h3>PVRoof Subscription Packages Terms:</h3>

          The quota (i.e., number of homeowner data) for each package (e.g., 1000 homeowner data per year) is never definitive and although we strive to ensure we reach every quota under selected packages, we cannot guarantee this number will be reached.

            <p class="bottom-margin _10-pixels">
              (Reuters) - On a bright, chilly morning in a small town east of Madrid, Esther Banales stood outside her home as technicians scaled the roof to affix 16 shiny solar panels she hopes will cut her power bills by more than a third.
            </p>
            <p class="bottom-margin _10-pixels">
              Rooftop solar companies in sun-drenched Spain say a growing number of people are seeking home systems to avoid power prices that have soared as demand for gas to fuel post-pandemic recoveries clashed with tighter-than-usual supplies.
            </p>
            <p class="bottom-margin _10-pixels">
              "We saw how electricity bills were going up, and people are talking about whether we will have supply problems, so I decided it was the right time (for solar)," Banales said.
            </p>
            <p class="bottom-margin _10-pixels">
              Demand is booming in several European countries, according to Otovo, the Norway-based company that arranged Banales's installation.
            </p>
            <p class="bottom-margin _10-pixels">
              "In the case of Spain, we are talking about where we had one customer interested last year, we have three today," said Inigo Amoribieta, who is in charge of Otovo's Spanish business.
            </p>
            <p class="bottom-margin _10-pixels">
              Power bills have risen almost 12% on average in Spain since 2018, and under one widely-used tariff they were 50% higher in the first two weeks of November than in the same period last year, according to consumer association FACUA.
            </p>
            <p class="bottom-margin _10-pixels">
              Installations like Banales's include an inverter which changes the raw power into electricity she can use.
            </p>
            <p class="bottom-margin _10-pixels">
              All of this equipment does not come cheap - she paid around 7,600 euros ($8,597) - but expects to recoup that soon.
            </p>
            <p class="bottom-margin _10-pixels" style="height: 20px;"></p>
            <p class="bottom-margin _10-pixels">
              Spanish renewable energy trade group APPA says that if prices stay at current highs, home solar systems could save 40-60% on annual power bills. With government subsidies of some 900 million euros, complemented by local tax breaks, the cost would be redeemed in five years, APPA says.
            </p>
            <p class="bottom-margin _10-pixels">
              Since 2018, when Spain lifted a charge on excess power going back to the grid, known as a "sun tax", independent generation has become a way for Spaniards to "vaccinate" themselves against high prices, said Jose Donoso, head of solar association UNEF.âââ
